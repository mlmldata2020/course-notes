    "- This model is used to determine weights when gridding the data. This provides \"optimal\" weights based on the covariance structure of the data, without the implicit assumptions of simpler models like the inverse distance model. \n",
    "- This type of analysis also allows a \"mapping error\" to be computed. \n",
    "- The mapping error reduces to the *unresolved variance* at zero lag - this includes the variance at smaller scales than those measured or variation in time that occurs as the samples are being collected. \n",
    "- The mapping error is equal to the variance at large scales. In practice, maps often mask regions of high mapping error to avoid misinterpretation of those values."
