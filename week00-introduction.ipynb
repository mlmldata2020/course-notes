    "__Discrete__ - represented by an integer (whole number)- counts, presence/absence <br>\n",
    "__Continuous__ - represented by real<sup>1</sup> numbers (e.g. temperature, wave speed, length of an organism, concentration)  <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "where $N-1$ is the __degrees of freedom__. Degrees of freedom are the number of independent pieces of information. The variance of one sample ($N=1$) is essentially meaningless because it is always equal to zero, no matter what the value of the sample is. In this case, there are no degrees of freedom. Calculating the variance/standard deviation with $N-1$ in the denominator is called the __unbiased__ estimate of the true standard deviation $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance is __positive definite__ because it is the sum of squared values and therefore cannot be negative.\n",

    "$$ SE = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N}}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error does not describe the spread of the data, it describes the how well the sample mean, $\\bar{x}$, represents the true mean, $\\mu$. The standard error can thought of as the standard deviation of $(\\bar{x} - \\mu)$, after many repeated experiments with $N$ samples. "
