    "## Types of Data \n",
    "__Discrete__ - represented by an integer (whole number)- counts, presence/absence <br>\n",
    "__Continuous__ - represented by real<sup>1</sup> numbers (e.g. temperature, wave speed, length of an organism, concentration)  <br>\n",
    "__Categorical__ - examples: species, sediment type, hair color, site # <br>\n",

    "Orange line: Normal distribution (hypothetical), allows the use of mathematical theories to use statistics. The shape of the normal distribution is defined by two parameters - the mean and standard deviation. This theoretical curve has the same mean and standard deviation as the sample distribution.  <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "where $N-1$ is the __degrees of freedom__. Degrees of freedom are the number of independent pieces of information. The variance of one sample ($N=1$) is essentially meaningless because it is always equal to zero, no matter what the value of the sample is. In this case, there are no degrees of freedom. Calculating the variance/standard deviation with $N-1$ in the denominator is called the __unbiased__ estimate of the true standard deviation $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance is __positive definite__ because it is the sum of squared values and therefore cannot be negative.\n",

    "### Standard Error ###\n",

    "The __standard error__ describes how well the sample mean describes the true mean\n",

The standard error can thought of as an estimate of the standard deviation of $(\\bar{x} - \\mu)$, after many repeated experiments with $N$ samples. \n",

    "Results from 100 repeated trials during same storm (N = 200 each trial). The $x$-axis is the same as that shown for the sample distribution above, to emphasize how the distribution of means clusters more tightly together. We can think of these repeated trials as different instruments measuring different waves in the same storm. Note that this is easy to do with a computer-generated example dataset, but not so easy to do in practices.\n",
