    "For _linear_ problems, you can set up a design matrix and use the least squares fit. Examples we have already discussed include:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear regression: $ y = mx + b $<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple linear regression: $ y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 $<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple linear regression with interaction term: $ y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_1x_2 $<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Harmonic fit: $ y = a_1 + a_2 \\sin(x) + a_3 \\cos(x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems are all classified as linear, even if the functions do not descirbe only straight lines, because the unknown coefficients are on the outside the terms in the equation.\n",
