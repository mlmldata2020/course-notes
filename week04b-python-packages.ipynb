    "#### Breaking down parts of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python file has several parts. The first two lines are comment lines, and are therefore not run as Python code. However, they contain important information about the file and they are include automatically when you create a new file in Spyder. The first line,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is the \"shebang\" line, and this is specific to Unix-based operating systems (like Mac OSX and Linux). It tells the shell that this file can be run as a scipt. The second line,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "specifies how the text file that contains the source code is formatted. This line allows you to use Unicode characters. Both of these lines are optional. The next line,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'''A module for converting units.'''\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is a docstring for the module, which helps a user figure out what is in the module and what its purpose is. Like the comment lines, this line is not run as code. After the doc-string, two function are defined, and then comes another part of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "\tprint('do this stuff if run as script')\n",
    "\tprint('32 degrees F:',temp_f2c(32),'C')\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Running the file\n",
    "\n",
    "The part of the file above is only run as a script (not when it is imported as a module in another Python file, which is what will be demonstrated in the next section). In Spyder, this can be done with the \"Run\" button. Python scripts can also be run from the shell (e.g. Mac Terminal, or Git Bash shell). The convert.py file can be run by navigating to its directory in the shell and typing\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python convert.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "do this stuff if run as script                                                                              \n",
    "32 degrees F: 0.0 C       \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a python file in this way executes all of the Python code in the file, including the contents of the section that starts with `if __name__ == '__main__':`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing as a module\n",
    "\n",
    "To show how to import the convert.py as a module, and use the functions in another file, we create a simple script called [myscript.py](scripts/myscipt.py):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n",
    "\n",
    "import convert\n",
    "\n",
    "ctemp = 40\n",
    "ftemp = convert.temp_c2f(ftemp)\n",
    "print(ctemp,'C is ',ftemp,'F')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The import statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the file above, the conversion module is imported with the statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import convert\n",
    "```\n",
    "The functions in that module can then be used, like in the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ftemp = convert.temp_c2f(ftemp)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running the file\n",
    "\n",
    "This file can be run from the shell, with the command,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python myscript.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "40 C is  104.0 F   \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note what is code is _not_ run, which is the contents of the `if __name__ == '__main__':` section of convert.py. When a Python file is imported as a module, this part of the code is not run. This is a good place to put demonstrations of functions in a module, or tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing a module located in a another directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the module that you want to import is not in the current directory you are working in. For example, you may want to have a set of useful functions stored in a `MyTools` directory somewhere on your computer, and be able to access those functions from multiple different project directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Option 1: Setting your PYTHONPATH\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to import a module, Python has to know where to look for it. It knows to look in the current diectory (say, the directory from which you are running a script), but it does not search your entire computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the PYTHONPATH environment variable, you can specify other directories where Python should look for modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "* One way to modify your Python path is through the menu in Spyder. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You can add a directory (e.g. `path/to/MyTools`) to your PYTHONPATH with the following Python commands:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "sys.path.append(\"path/to/MyTools\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to keep track of things is to keep all of your useful modules in one directory on your computer, then add that single directory to your PYTHONPATH. If you ever want to share your code with somebody else, it will help to not have files scattered all over your computer. See [this blog post by Brown Dwarf Research](http://www.bdnyc.org/2012/09/editing-pythonpath-to-import-modules/), where the above example came from, for more really useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Option #2 (better): Creating a package\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, if you edit your path using `sys.path`, the changes are not permanent. There are several ways of adding modules to you path permanently. The best option, which works on any operating system, is to create and install your own package. To create a package called `mytools`, the basic directory stucture should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MyTools/\n",
    "    setup.py\n",
    "    mytools/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        convert.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `convert.py` is a Python file containing your useful functions in a module. The `__init__.py` file is empty (if you wish, it could be used to execute code upon importing the `mytools` package).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `setup.py` file describes the contents of the package, and the location of module files. An example of the contents of a minimal `setup.py` file is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from setuptools import setup\n",
    "\n",
    "setup(name='mytools', \n",
    "      packages=['mytools'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A more complete `setup.py` file would include more information describing the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from setuptools import setup\n",
    "\n",
    "setup(name='mytools', \n",
    "      packages=['mytools'],\n",
    "      version=0.1,\n",
    "      author='Tom Connolly',\n",
    "      author_email='tconnolly@mlml.calstate.edu',\n",
    "      description='A collection of useful Python tools.',\n",
    "      license='CC BY')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created the package, run this command in the shell (making sure the `MyTools` directory is your present working directory):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run this command from the Python console if you precede it with a `!`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `!` tells Python to run the command in an operating system shell, rather than executing it as Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `pip` is a package manager (included in Anaconda), the -e indicates that the package should be installed in \"developer mode\" (so you do not have to re-run pip if you make changes,), and `.` indicates the present working directory. Now your package is installed and your tools are on the Python path and available to imported whenever you start up Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mytools import convert\n",
    "\n",
    "convert.f2c(32.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The package described above is very basic. You can add many more module files to the `mytools` directory, in addition to `convert.py`. You can also add additional directories, if you have categories of modules that you want to organize within the package. If you want to share your package, you can put it on Github or even put it on the Python package index, so that others can automatically `pip install` it. More useful information on packages can be found at https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write two more unit conversion functions (converting one way and back).\n",
    "* Use one in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` section of convert.py\n",
    "* Use the other in myscript.py\n",
    "* Run these files from the shell, and see what parts of the code are run"
