    "* Radiochemists study discrete decay events, which follow a Poisson distribution. A few samples will give a biased estimate of the mean rate of radioactive decay. If enough samples are collected, the sample mean and 95% confidence intervals can be calculated using the formulas described above.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Physical oceanographers routinely take advantage of the central limit theorem when using observations of pressure or velocity measurements to study processes with time scales much longer than individual waves. The probability distribution of a wavy sea surface is not normal at all, but by collecting many samples (a.k.a. and ensemble) over a period of ~10-20 minutes we can effectively \"average out\" the waves and be confident in the mean of that ensemble. \n",
