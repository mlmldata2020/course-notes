    "The goal of *principal component analysis (PCA)* is to efficiently represent variability that is common among multiple variables. One application is to create an \"index\" that describes how different variables co-vary, or how a single variable co-varies in different places. *Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs)* are a very similar type of analysis that involves the same basic steps (often seen in Physical Oceanography or Meteorology literature).\n",

This analysis, which is described in detail below, creates a new coordinate frame that maximizes variability along an axis (PC1) and corresponding orthogonal axis (PC2) where PC1 PC2 are uncorrelated.\n",
