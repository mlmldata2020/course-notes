    "The goal of *principal component analysis (PCA)* is to efficiently represent variability that is common among multiple variables. One application is to create an \"index\" that describes how different variables co-vary, or how a single variable co-varies in different places. *Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs)* are a very similar type of analysis that involves the same basic steps (often seen in Physical Oceanography or Meteorology literature).\n",
